    The body as an interface

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>With the rise of digital technology, both <br>our learning and our communications <br>are increasingly mediated by interfaces, <br>programs and machines. If this opens up new <br>possibilities, particularly for the acquisition <br>and exchange of knowledge, we still too little <br>question the invisible constraints that result <br>from it. <br> Are we conditioned by our interfaces? <br> How much freedom do we have? <br> How does this change our relationship to the <br>world? In this project, I am attempting to suppress the <br>conventional interface and allow the performer, <br>through their movements (spreading of arms, <br>hand position and gestures, etc.), to determine <br>the various parameters of the virtual brush.</p>
