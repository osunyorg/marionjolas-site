        <p>With the rise of digital technology, both our learning and our communications are increasingly mediated by interfaces, programs and machines. If this opens up new possibilities, particularly for the acquisition and exchange of knowledge, we still too little question the invisible constraints that result from it. </p><p><i>Are we conditioned by our interfaces? </i></p><p><i>How much freedom do we have? </i></p><p><i>How does this change our relationship to the world?</i></p><p>In this project, I am attempting to suppress the conventional interface and allow the performer, through their movements (spreading of arms, hand position and gestures, etc.), to determine the various parameters of the virtual brush.</p>
